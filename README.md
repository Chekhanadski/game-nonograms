## Description
Nonograms is a classic puzzle game where players reveal a hidden picture by filling in cells on a grid based on numerical clues provided at the top and left side of the grid. Each number indicates an unbroken line of filled cells. The goal is to correctly fill all black cells to reveal the picture.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The game is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for optimal playability.
- **Interactive Grid:** Players can click on cells to fill them, using left-click to fill with black and right-click to mark with an 'X'. Clicking a filled cell will empty it.
- **Game End Notification:** The game ends when all black cells are correctly filled, displaying a congratulatory message.
- **Multiple Templates:** The game includes at least 5 templates for the 5x5 grid, allowing players to choose which picture to solve.
- **Stopwatch:** Tracks the duration of the game, starting on the first click and displaying the time taken upon completion.
- **Sound Effects:** Feedback for events like filling a cell, marking a cell, and winning the game.
- **Save and Continue:** Players can save their progress and continue from where they left off.
- **Themes:** Dark and light themes for a personalized gaming experience.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Three levels of difficulty - easy (5x5), medium (10x10), and hard (15x15), each with at least 5 templates.
- **High Score Table:** Records the latest 5 win results, sorted by completion time.
- **Random Game:** A button to start a random game with a randomly selected template and difficulty level.

## Setting Up and Running the Project Locally

Here are the steps to get you started:

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed a live server extension (e.g., Live Server for VS Code).
- You have a Windows/Linux/Mac machine.

### Setting Up the Project
To set up the project, follow these steps:

**1. Clone the repository**

Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository, and run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nonograms-game.git
```

This will clone the repository to your local machine.

**2. Navigate to the project directory**

Change your current directory to the project directory:

```sh
cd game-nonograms
```

**3. Open the project in your code editor**

If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can open the project with:

```sh
code .
```

**4. Run the project using a live server**

If you have the Live Server extension installed in VS Code, right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server".

Alternatively, if you are using another live server tool, start it in the directory containing the index.html file.

This will start a local development server and the project will be up and running on your local machine.
